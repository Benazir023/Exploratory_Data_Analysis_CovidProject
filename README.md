# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_CovidProject

Hello there, 

Herein is an exploratory data analysis of covid19 data obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. SQL Server was used in doing this. 
Visualization of some queries can be found here https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/benazir1261/viz/COVID19_EDA_16787821324450/Dashboard1.
Feel free to interact with my code and myself if you have any queries/feedback, etc.

The analysis for covid19.csv can be found in the R script hereby attached.

Thanks for your time.
